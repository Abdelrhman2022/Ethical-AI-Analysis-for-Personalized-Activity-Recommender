# Ethical-AI-Analysis-for-Personalized-Activity-Recommender
This project focuses on designing a budget prediction model for **IDOOU**, a mobile app that recommends local activities such as visiting a park, sightseeing, or going to a movie theater. IDOOU personalizes its recommendations using features like **gender**, **age**, and **education level** to enhance the user experience.
